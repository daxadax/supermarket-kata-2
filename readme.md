#Supermarket Kata Round 2

Slightly modified from the kata found [here](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html)

In this Kata, my goals were: 

* more descriptive method names
* more readable methods
* testing which adheres more to 'best practices', specifically not testing private methods explicitly 

 
Things that still need work:

* minimize excessive attr_* lists
* "get_discounts" is messy #FIXED
